# CAT LINK

CAT LINK is a C++/Python interface used for a new track-finding algorithm in the Belle II experiment. This project builds upon the work of Lea Reuter [^1]. CAT LINK was developed as part of a bachelors's thesis by Yannis Kl√ºgl at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Institute of Experimental Particle Physics.
